We recently completed The Public Architecture and Design Research Instituteâ€™s (PADRI) inaugural conference and exhibition coinciding with, and part of the Thinking Creatively Conference! PADRI was organized to support the research initiatives of [Wenzhou-Kean University (WKU)](wku.edu.cn), [Michael Graves College (MGC)](http://design.wku.edu.cn/) faculty and students. This year's conference and exhibition featured projects from every department in the college, including Graphic Design, Interior Design, Industrial Design, and Architecture.

We had a student team who developed a logo design for the Institute and a faculty member selected for best research project.
