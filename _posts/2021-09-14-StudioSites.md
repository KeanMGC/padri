We have recently been developing an archive of work from some of the studios. This work is being archived using GitHub. We feel that GitHub is an important platform for sharing information, one that has a high probability of longevity. We feel that student exposure to such platforms is an important part of an architectural education in the 21st centery.

In the spring of 2021 the third year studios documented their work. One entitled: [Traveling Studio](https://w03travelstudio.wordpress.com/) and the other entitled: ["Purpose-built Cities"](https://steenblikrs.github.io/2021-Spring-Studio/). This fall there is another studio entitled [Part to Whole - Global to Local](https://keanmgc.github.io/2021fall3yr-studio/), also documenting their work.

There are also previously archived course content for a studio entitled [Heterotic Architecture- Hybrid Buildings: Substructure, Superstructure, Infrastructure."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4ncbt37R2E&list=PLBtPB9RpflEZ9HoVBhDMIq7kyqf3rhElJ)

One of the [first year reviews is was documented](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6EXdvtq_wrmi1GhJBOULr8KejK5M6h60) and can be found in this Youtube playlist.
